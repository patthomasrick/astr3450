	abstract = {The Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation ({HI}-{SEAS}) is an analog habitat for human spaceflight to Mars. {HI}-{SEAS} is located in an isolated position on the slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii. The area has Mars-like features and an elevation of approximately 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. The first {HI}-{SEAS} study was in 2013 and {NASA}'s Human Research Program continues to fund and sponsor follow-up studies.  The missions are of extended duration from four months to a year.
The purpose of the detailed research studies is to determine what is required to keep a space flight crew happy and healthy during an extended mission to Mars and while living on Mars. Research into food, crew dynamics, behaviors, roles and performance, and other aspects of space flight and a mission on Mars itself is the primary focus. The {HI}-{SEAS} researchers also carry out studies on a variety of other topics as part of their daily activities.
One thing under study by {NASA} is trying to understand crew dynamics such as morale, stress management, and how they solve problems as group.},

	abstract = {Hawaii ( (listen) hə-{WY}-ee; Hawaiian: Hawaiʻi [həˈvɐjʔi]) is a state of the United States of America located in the Pacific Ocean. It is the only U.S. state located outside North America and the only island state.
The state encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 islands spread over 1,500 miles (2,400 km). The volcanic archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are, in order from northwest to southeast: Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and the largest, Hawaiʻi, which the state is named after. It is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. 
Hawaii is the 8th-smallest geographically and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the 50 states. It is the only state with an Asian American plurality. Hawaii has more than 1.4 million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. The state capital and largest city is Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu. The state's ocean coastline is about 750 miles (1,210 km) long, the fourth longest in the U.S., after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida, and California. Hawaii is the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959. It was an independent nation until 1898.
Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian culture.},

At approximately 5 p.m. Hawaiʻi Standard Time ({HST}) on Thursday, February 15, they will enter a geodesic dome habitat atop Mauna Loa on the island of Hawai‘i as part of an eight-month research study of human behavior and performance. The {NASA}-funded project aims to help determine the individual and team requirements for long-duration space exploration missions, including travel to Mars.},
