This mission is twice as long as any previously completed at the Hawaiʻi site, and second only to Russia’s Mars500 experiment in total duration.\n\nUH Mānoa researchers and their collaborators will be studying the group’s cohesion over time, gathering data on a wide range of cognitive, social and emotional factors that may impact team performance.\n\n“The HI-SEAS site presents a remarkably high-fidelity environment for this type of long-duration space study,” said UH Mānoa’s Kim Binsted, the principal investigator for the study. “Looking out the single porthole window, all you can see are lava fields and Maunakea in the distance. Once the door is closed, and the faux airlock sealed, the silence and physical separation contribute to the ‘long way from home’ experience of our crew members.”\n\nAn upcoming seminar on March 25th will feature Jocelyn Dunn, a participant of the Hi-SEAS mission. Because of the delay, the seminar will be pre-recorded from inside the simulation dome and, as such, we invite you submit any questions you may have for the participants of the project ahead of time so that they can be addressed by the speaker. You can read more about the project below. Please email your questions for the crew member to: Esther Beltran or Ashley Kehoe\n\nOur next seminar will be held on February 25th and the full schedule of the Spring Semester Series is available at the following link: https://fsi.ucf.edu/seminars/ .\n\nAt this seminar we will have Jocelyn Dunn, a crew member from inside the dome, and the Principal Investigator Dr.Kim Binsted on the outside in real time. One of the goals for HI-SEAS is exploring how to effectively promote crew autonomy. With a mission to Mars, the wide distance makes communication difficult. Depending on the current positions of Mars and Earth in their orbits, information packets from Earth take between 10-25 minutes to reach Mars. Therefore, a crew on Mars should be able to operate autonomously, rather than waiting for orders from mission control. During the HI-SEAS mission, instead of “Mission Control,” we have a “Mission Support” team.\n\n“The only communication we can have with the outside world, including mission support, is through email on a NASA network that is delayed 20 minutes to simulate the distance from Earth” Jocelyn Dunn.\n\nFor more information of the HI-SEAS mission, Jocelyn Dunn and Dr. Kim Binsted please go to the links below:\n\nhttp://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2014/Q3/purdue-student-to-live-in-simulated-space-habitat–.html\n\nhttp://hi-seas.org/\n\nhttp://manoa.hawaii.edu/news/article.php?aId=6751\n\nPosted by: Soderman/SSERVI Staff\nSource: SSERVI Team\nTagged with: CLASS • habitat • hi-seas • Mars • simulated  \nShare →\nELS 2020\nCLASS/FSI Seminar\n\nCLASS/FSI Seminar Series 2020\n\nJan 14 - Apr 7, 2020\nNESF2020 – Virtual\nForum Archives\nLSSW – Postponed\nLunar Landing Workshop\n\nView the publication here\nUpcoming Events\nApril\n\nLunar Surface Science Workshop\nPOSTPONED (Denver, CO)\n\nLunar Volatiles Workshop Without Walls\nCANCELED (Virtual)\n\nView More Upcoming\nView Past Events\nSSERVI Team Science\n\n    Filling in the Missing History of the Universe\n    loeb\n\n    By probing the Dark Ages of the universe, researchers are searching for the moment when the stars first turned on.\n\nMore Highlights\nDid you know?\n\nOnly about 59 percent of the moon's surface is visible to us here on earth.\n\nRead More\n \nSolar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute\n \n\n    Home\n    Overview\n    Science\n    Missions\n    Public Engagement\n    Press\n    Events\n\n \nNASA Privacy Policy\n \nNASA Official\nGregory Schmidt\n \nSolar System Exploration\nResearch Virtual Institute\n\n \n"}
