 in its sixth year, the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa’s Hawaiʻi Space 
Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) is set to begin its next 
mission with the most international crew in the history of the research 
project.</p><p>The four astronaut-like Mission VI crewmembers hail from 
Australia, Korea, Scotland and Slovakia. At approximately 5 p.m. Hawaiʻi
 Standard Time (HST) on Thursday, February 15, they will enter a 
geodesic dome habitat atop Mauna Loa on the island of Hawai‘i as part of
 an eight-month research study of human behavior and performance. The 
NASA-funded project aims to help determine the individual and team 
requirements for long-duration space exploration missions, including 
travel to Mars.</p><p><strong>Sukjin Han</strong> is an assistant professor in economics at University of Texas at Austin.</p><p><strong>Calum&nbsp;Hervieu</strong>&nbsp;is astrophysicist and systems engineer from rural Scotland.</p><p><strong>Lisa Stojanovski </strong>is a professional science communicator, who manages the Australian chapter of the Space Generation Advisory Council.</p><p><strong>Michaela&nbsp;Musilova</strong>&nbsp;is an astrobiologist with a research focus on&nbsp;life in extreme environments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Meet the HI-SEAS Mission VI crew:</strong> <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/02/12/hi-seas-mission-vi-most-international-in-study-history/">https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2018/02/12/hi-seas-mission-vi-most-international-in-study-history/</a></p><p>The
 crew started nine days of briefings and training on Wednesday, February
 7, joined by scientific researchers and mission support to prepare for 
HI-SEAS Mission VI. &nbsp;</p><p>HI-SEAS Principal Investigator and 
University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Professor, Kim Binsted is excited about 
the international diversity of Mission VI and the role HI-SEAS plays in 
understanding human behavior and performance in space.</p><p>“This is 
the first time we’ve selected a crew that includes members from four 
different countries of origin. As HI-SEAS is an international 
collaboration between researchers, mission support and crew, it is great
 to see this diversity reflected in the Mission VI crew,” said 
Binsted.“For humans to successfully undertake a long-duration 
spaceflight to Mars, it will require a global collaboration, and so it 
seems appropriate that our Mission VI begins with this spirit of 
internationalism.”</p><p>During the eight-month mission the crew will 
perform exploration tasks such as geological fieldwork and life systems 
management. The mission is conducted under isolated and confined 
&nbsp;conditions designed to be similar to those of a planetary surface 
exploration mission. For example, all communications are delayed by 20 
minutes in each direction to simulate the time it takes a message to 
travel between Earth and Mars. Daily routines include food preparation 
from only shelf-stable ingredients, exercise, research and field work 
aligned with NASA’s planetary exploration expectations.</p><p>Under the 
watchful eye of the research team and supported by experienced mission 
control, the crew will participate in multiple primary and opportunistic
 research studies. The primary research is conducted by scientists from 
across the United States who are at the forefront of their fields.</p><p>The
 primary behavioral research includes a shared social behavioral task 
for team building, continuous monitoring of face-to-face interactions 
with sociometric badges, a virtual reality team-based collaborative 
exercise to predict individual and team behavioral health and 
performance and multiple stress and cognitive countermeasure and 
monitoring studies. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>HI-SEAS
 Mission VI continues a series of successful 8-month and 12-month 
missions that place HI-SEAS in the company of a small group of analogs 
capable of operating very long duration missions in isolated and 
confined environments such as Mars500, Concordia and the International 
Space Station.</p><p><strong>END</strong></p><p><strong>HI-SEAS Mission VI media kit available for download at: &nbsp;<a href="http://hi-seas.org/?p=4353">http://hi-seas.org/?p=4353</a></strong></p><p><strong>Media

 &nbsp;After eight months of isolation in a geodesic dome on the slopes 
of Mauna Loa, six Hawai‘i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation 
(HI-SEAS) crew members felt the sun and wind on their faces and ate 
fresh tropical papaya, pineapple and bananas with friends and family.</p><p>When: &nbsp;Sunday, September 15, 2017 at 9 a.m. HST &nbsp;(The crew exited at 9:04 a.m. HST)</p><p>Who: &nbsp;HI-SEAS Principal Investigator is University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa Professor Kim Binsted. &nbsp;T</p><p>Where: &nbsp;The HI-SEAS habitat on Mars-like lower flank of Mauna Loa on Hawai‘i Island (8,200 feet above seal level). &nbsp;</p><p>Why:
 &nbsp;The University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa research project, funded by 
NASA, will help with the selection of crews for future long-duration

memorable experience for the Mission V crew for a variety of reasons, 
including having to live with a communications delay, eating mostly 
shelf-stable foods and having to wear “space suits” outside of the

the future exploration of Mars and the future exploration of Space in 
general.”</p><p>Brian Ramos, Health and Performance Officer, HI-SEAS V(:12)</p><p>“One
 of the things I missed from home was Portuguese cooking because my 
parents and family are from the Azores, so we made some malasadas.

 term space travel is absolutely possible. There are certainly technical
 challenges to be overcome. There are certainly human factors to be 
figured out, that’s part of what HI-SEAS is for. But I think that 
overcoming those challenges is just a matter of effort. We are 
absolutely capable of it.”</p><p>Brian Ramos, health and performance officer, HI-SEAS V (14 seconds)</p><p>“My
 advice to mission six is say, ‘Yes.’ If you have an opportunity whether
 it’s filming or learning a new science skill or flying the drone, going
 out to a lava tube, whatever it is, say, ‘Yes.’ Take leadership on 
things. Honestly you can come out of here in eight months learning a ton
 of stuff.”</p><p>Ansley Barnard, engineering officer, HI-SEAS V (12 seconds)</p><p>“Remember
 that the toilet systems are also a system and they’re a living system. 
So stay in balance with those, let them talk to you if they smell a 
certain way or act a certain way they’re trying to tell you something, 
so listen.”</p><p>Barnard (17 seconds)</p><p>“As the crew engineer, Iʻve
 had a lot of time to get to know the habitat. We have mostly a loving 
relationship, but there are times where you can get frustrated. &nbsp;So
 my advice for the next crew is to stay patient and remember that even 
though the habitat can kind of take care of itself, that you are a 
steward for it.”</p><p>###</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul></ul></div>
