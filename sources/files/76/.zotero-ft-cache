HI-SEAS Mission VI has been cancelled as a crew member has voluntarily withdrawn their participation in the study. Regrettably, it is not possible to perform a mission with a crew of three. Further, an investigation is ongoing into an incident which occurred on February 19, 2018, temporarily suspending the mission. After a full safety inspection of the habitat has been performed, a new call for applicants will be released to compose a new crew for another mission based on a review by the institutional review board.
