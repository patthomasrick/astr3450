# A Glimpse Into a Mars Base Right Here on Earth

With Earth preparing for our first foray out into space beyond Low Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo era, we have set our eyes on not only the Moon but also Mars. NASA has been devising a plan to send humans to a nearby asteroid and Mars, however a mission to Mars could take [upwards of one-thousand days](https://nvite.jsc.nasa.gov/presentations/b2/D1_Mars_Connolly.pdf). This introduces a unique set of problems. For example, we know that long-term spaceflight is quite dangerous and destructive to humans.

One of these pressing concerns about a Mars mission how to set up an effective, comfortable, accommodating base on the surface of Mars, one that is relatively inexpensive but strong, functional and built-for-science but comfortable. One such group researched this very concept here on Earth in the HI-SEAS project.

## What is the HI-SEAS Project?

[Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or HI-SEAS](https://hi-seas.org/), is operated by the University of Hawaii and exists in an isolated location of the Mauna Loa region on the Big Island of Hawaii[HI-SEAS]. The entire project is a human-performance mission funded by NASA and aims to study group cohesion and performance over time [HI-SEAS Mission 3]. The project has striking resemblance to a real mission, as described and listed on their project webpage and quoted below:

> 1. we select the crew to meet our research needs (in serendipitous analogs, such as Antarctic stations, crew selection criteria are not controlled by researchers);
> 2. the conditions (Habitat, mission, communications, etc.) are explicitly designed to be similar to those of a planetary exploration mission;
> 3. the site is accessible year round, and has very little variation in weather, allowing longer-duration isolated and confined environment studies than at other locations;
> 4. the Mars-like environment provides for high-fidelity analog tasks, such as geological field work carried out by human explorers and/or robots.

## Location

And briefly mentioned above, the location of the base offers many advantages compared to other long-duration crew mission studies. The location is in an abandoned quarry on a mountainside. This, combined with the region's natural terrain and makeup, results in a landscape covered with reddish-brown boulders and closely emulates mountainous regions of Mars.

Due to Hawaii's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and having strong trade winds that blow across the ideas, the HI-SEAS Mars base tends to have very consistent weather. The temperature averaging between 65 degrees Fahrenheit to a balmy 88 degrees, which is much higher than that of the surface of Mars, which can range from 68 degrees at noon on the equator of Mars to -243 degrees at a pole. Hawaii's dry season lasts from May to October. The dry season is when the weather is most similar to Mars' dry and spare atmosphere. However, by design of the experiment, the candidates living in the base always wear EVA suits outside, so the temperature is irrelevant.

## Habitat

Besides the excellent choice of location, HI-SEAS has carefully designed their habitat to as closely as possible represent the conditions and constraints that astronauts would have to face. This includes a twenty minute communication delay between the base and mission control as well as complete self-sufficiency part from occasional cargo drops.

The habitat in question is a dome that is 36 feet in diameter, complete with a kitchen, dining room, bathroom, shower, lab, exercise room, common spaces, and six bedrooms. The dome is split into two floors: the first floor, which is most of the common and work rooms, and the second floor, which is bedrooms and a half-bathroom. In addition, there an external lab connected to the back of the habitat.

### First Floor

The first floor contains all of the workspaces, exercise equipment, kitchen, bathroom, and common areas. Since the second floor only extends to half of the top of the dome, the rest of the empty space is above the main common area and results in a quite high, vaulted ceiling. Each crew member gets their own desk at which they complete their work. Their exercise equipment includes an exercise bike, a pull-up bar, and a treadmill, and some crew members have opted to run up and down the stairs to the second floor for exercise.

The bathroom is a full bathroom that includes a stall shower, a sink, and a toilet. The toilet is special in that it does not run using water but with a electric motor that composts the waste.

The lab in the habitat contains many biological experiments and plants and is separate from the rest of the open living space on the first floor. 

There is also an airlock on the side of the hab and contains most of the food for the crew as well. Entering and exiting the hab requires a spacesuit and five minutes of depressurization/pressurization, the same that would be required on Mars.

### Second Floor

The second floor is primarily bedrooms and a half-bathroom that just contains another electric toilet and sink. Since the rooms are at the top of the dome, they have sloped ceilings. However, there is still enough room for each crew member to fully stand up in each room.
