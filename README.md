With Earth preparing for our first foray out into space beyond Low Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo era, we have set our eyes on not only the Moon but also Mars. NASA has been devising a plan to send humans to a nearby asteroid and Mars, however a mission to Mars could take [upwards of one-thousand days](https://nvite.jsc.nasa.gov/presentations/b2/D1_Mars_Connolly.pdf).<sup>1</sup> This introduces a unique set of problems that will test both our engineering capabilities as well as our physiological limits.

One of these pressing concerns about a Mars mission how to set up an effective, comfortable, accommodating base on the surface of Mars, one that is relatively inexpensive but strong, functional and built-for-science but comfortable. One such group researched this very concept here on Earth in the HI-SEAS project.

## What is the HI-SEAS Project?

[Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or HI-SEAS](https://hi-seas.org/),<sup>5</sup> is operated by the University of Hawaii and exists in an isolated location of the Mauna Loa region on the Big Island of Hawaii.<sup>5,7</sup> The entire project is a human-performance mission funded by NASA and aims to study group cohesion and performance over time.<sup>6</sup> The project has striking resemblance to a real mission, as described and listed on their project webpage and quoted below:

> 1. we select the crew to meet our research needs (in serendipitous analogs, such as Antarctic stations, crew selection criteria are not controlled by researchers);
> 2. the conditions (Habitat, mission, communications, etc.) are explicitly designed to be similar to those of a planetary exploration mission;
> 3. the site is accessible year round, and has very little variation in weather, allowing longer-duration isolated and confined environment studies than at other locations;
> 4. the Mars-like environment provides for high-fidelity analog tasks, such as geological field work carried out by human explorers and/or robots.

## Location

And briefly mentioned above, the location of the base offers many advantages compared to other long-duration crew mission studies. The location is in an abandoned quarry on a mountainside. This, combined with the region's natural terrain and makeup, results in a landscape covered with reddish-brown boulders and closely emulates mountainous regions of Mars.

Due to Hawaii's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and having strong trade winds that blow across the ideas, the HI-SEAS Mars base tends to have very consistent weather<sup>5</sup>. The temperature averaging between 65 degrees Fahrenheit to a balmy 88 degrees,<sup>3</sup> which is much higher than that of the surface of Mars, which can range from 68 degrees at noon on the equator of Mars to -243 degrees at a pole. Hawaii's dry season lasts from May to October. The dry season is when the weather is most similar to Mars' dry and spare atmosphere. However, by design of the experiment, the candidates living in the base always wear EVA suits outside, so the temperature is irrelevant.

## Habitat

Besides the excellent choice of location, HI-SEAS has carefully designed their habitat to as closely as possible represent the conditions and constraints that astronauts would have to face. This includes a twenty minute communication delay between the base and mission control as well as complete self-sufficiency part from occasional cargo drops.<sup>5,6</sup>

The habitat in question is a dome that is 36 feet in diameter, complete with a kitchen, dining room, bathroom, shower, lab, exercise room, common spaces, and six bedrooms. The dome is split into two floors: the first floor, which is most of the common and work rooms, and the second floor, which is bedrooms and a half-bathroom. In addition, there an external lab connected to the back of the habitat.<sup>5</sup>

### First Floor

The first floor contains all of the workspaces, exercise equipment, kitchen, bathroom, and common areas. Since the second floor only extends to half of the top of the dome, the rest of the empty space is above the main common area and results in a quite high, vaulted ceiling. Each crew member gets their own desk at which they complete their work. Their exercise equipment includes an exercise bike, a pull-up bar, and a treadmill, and some crew members have opted to run up and down the stairs to the second floor for exercise.<sup>8</sup>

The bathroom is a full bathroom that includes a stall shower, a sink, and a toilet. The toilet is special in that it does not run using water but with a electric motor that composts the waste.

The lab in the habitat contains many biological experiments and plants and is separate from the rest of the open living space on the first floor. 

There is also an airlock on the side of the hab and contains most of the food for the crew as well. Entering and exiting the hab requires a spacesuit and five minutes of depressurization/pressurization, the same that would be required on Mars.<sup>4</sup>

### Second Floor

The second floor is primarily bedrooms and a half-bathroom that just contains another electric toilet and sink. Since the rooms are at the top of the dome, they have sloped ceilings. However, there is still enough room for each crew member to fully stand up in each room.<sup>8</sup>

## Project Findings

HI-SEAS has successfully conducted five missions since 2013, with each mission having different focuses.<sup>4</sup> The first mission, HI-SEAS I, focused on culinary and psychological aspects mostly pertaining to the habitat temperature as well as crew diet and its effects. This mission lasted four months. HI-SEAS II lasted four months and focused more on team cohesion and performance. In addition, virtual reality technology was used in the crew's communications with their families and friends, and the effectiveness of such tools were analyzed. HI-SEAS III was an extension of HI-SEAS II and lasted eight months. HI-SEAS IV was a further extension of HI-SEAS II and III with an additional focus on the effects of long-duration isolation on cohesiveness and productivity. HI-SEAS IV also holds the record for the longest HI-SEAS mission, the longest NASA-funded space simulation conducted, and the second-longest space simulation conducted overall.<sup>4</sup> This mission lasted a whole year. HI-SEAS V lasted eight months and looked at team composition and dynamics and how that affected performance.

It was found that the crew of HI-SEAS IV started to form rifts between one another quickly, and these rifts stayed over the course of the entire mission. While the crew did enjoy having game nights approximately once a week. Lots of crew members used exercise as a way to escape, with some running entire marathons inside of the habitat. Group workouts also often took place, however these normally involved only a few crew members at a time. Crews were observed to form friend pairs in most conditions, and these pairs spent most of their time together.<sup>2</sup>

The crew tended to find dinner time unpleasant according to post-mission interviews. This was attributed to forced social interaction that touched on preexisting social tensions as well as the sheer amount of work that was normally reviewed during dinner time. Some whole-crew activities that took place at the beginning of the mission slowly lost members, with some activities eventually only involving as little as two members. Work activities of some crew members often collided with crew members who were trying to relax, annoying them. Hygiene was also an issue, and strict regulation of power usage resulted in short, cold showers and limited time for hygiene. In addition, the compositing electric toilet smelled.<sup>2</sup>

Privacy was hard to obtain in the habitat, as soundproofing of the dome was minimal and all common rooms were to be shared with six other crew members in close proximity. This combined with the open floor plan of the first floor made privacy even harder to find, which heightened social tensions. Crews reported that the dome was so poorly soundproofed that even private rooms only felt semi-private. Crews often resulted to hiding in the airlock as a place for small groups to socialize, but this area was also used for experiments and to store all of the food, which created more conflicts.<sup>2</sup>

## Current and Future Work

The last HI-SEAS mission, HI-SEAS VI, was scheduled to start on February 15th, 2017, and last a full eight months with four crew members.<sup>10</sup> However, only four days into the mission, a crew member was electrocuted by some equipment and taken to a nearby hospital, where they recovered.<sup>11</sup> The crew member did not want to continue the mission and withdrew, and since they could not operated with only three crew members, the mission had to be cancelled.<sup>9</sup>

NASA chose in 2018 rather to fund a mission VII, they chose to do an in-depth analysis of the data from the previous missions. They are doing so by giving a grant to HI-SEAS to support enhanced data mining of the mission data.<sup>4</sup>
