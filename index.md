# A Glimpse Into a Mars Base Right Here on Earth

With Earth preparing for our first foray out into space beyond Low Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo era, we have set our eyes on not only the Moon but also Mars. NASA has been devising a plan to send humans to a nearby asteroid and Mars, however a mission to Mars could take [upwards of one-thousand days](https://nvite.jsc.nasa.gov/presentations/b2/D1_Mars_Connolly.pdf). This introduces a unique set of problems. For example, we know that long-term spaceflight is quite dangerous and destructive to humans.

One of these pressing concerns about a Mars mission how to set up an effective, comfortable, accommodating base on the surface of Mars, one that is relatively inexpensive but strong, functional and built-for-science but comfortable. One such group researched this very concept here on Earth in the HI-SEAS project.
